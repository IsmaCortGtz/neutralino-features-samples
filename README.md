# neutralinojs-net-api-sample

This sample showcases the implementation of the Net API using [`pockethttp`](https://github.com/IsmaCortGtz/pocket-http).

The frontend is implemented using `vite` and `solidjs` to test the implementation of the frontend library too.

## Depndencies

1. `bin/`: Every binary inside this folder is compiled using [this fork](https://github.com/IsmaCortGtz/neutralinojs/tree/feature/net-api).
2. `@neutralinojs/lib`: This dependecy of the solidjs frontend is installed from [this fork](https://github.com/IsmaCortGtz/neutralino.js/tree/feature/net-api).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you have a previus `@neutralinojs/lib` version installed you maybe should need to clean cache with `npm cache clean --force`.
